# Introduction

This project simulates a system that manages startups, incentives, and citizens interested in sports activities. It uses TypeScript to define interfaces and classes that represent these concepts and their interactions.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into various folders and files:

- `src/`: Contains the TypeScript source files.
- `dist/`: Contains the compiled JavaScript files.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration file.

## How to Run

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2. Install TypeScript globally or as a project dependency:
    ```bash
    npm install -g typescript
    ```
3. Initialize the TypeScript project (if not already done):
    ```bash
    tsc --init
    ```
4. Start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode to automatically compile files whenever they are saved:
    ```bash
    tsc -w
    ```

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to use TypeScript to define classes and interfaces, implement business logic, and manage object interactions. You can extend this example by adding more features.
